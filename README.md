## Overview

Reference implementation for task-specific redundancy optimization in
cooperative dual-arm manipulation: null-space redundancy optimization that
preserves commanded object motion while shaping velocity, force, and
directional-force manipulability. The manuscript evaluates this on both
planar dual-arm hardware and a spatial dual-Franka MuJoCo simulation; this
repository implements the spatial simulation study, config-driven end to end
through a single CLI.

The older ROS 1, Gazebo, and MoveIt experiments that predate the MuJoCo
implementation are retained under `legacy/` for historical reference only
and are not part of the active Python environment.

## Implemented objectives

The optimization utilities implement four manuscript costs. "Directional
force" is not one formula: the manuscript defines two distinct,
non-equivalent objectives (Appendix A), and this repository implements both.

```text
Velocity (Eq. 13, maximized):
    W_v = sqrt(det(A A.T))

Force (Eq. 14, maximized):
    W_f = sqrt(det((A A.T)^dagger))

Directional force, direct (Eq. 16, minimized):
    normalized Frobenius distance between (A A.T)^dagger and F

Directional force, indirect (Eq. 17, maximized):
    normalized Frobenius distance between A A.T and F
```

The direct formulation (`--objective directional_force`) compares in
force-capability space and is the default/primary directional-force mode in
this spatial study. The indirect formulation
(`--objective directional_force_indirect`) compares in velocity-capability
space and is additionally evaluated in the static and six-dimensional
comparisons; it corresponds to the formulation used by the manuscript's
planar hardware experiments (see [Hardware implementation](#hardware-implementation)).
Full equation-by-function detail is in
[`docs/PAPER_CODE_MAP.md`](docs/PAPER_CODE_MAP.md).

## Quick start

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules \
  https://github.com/Debojit-D/Bimanual-Redundancy-Optimization.git
cd Bimanual-Redundancy-Optimization

uv venv --python 3.12 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

uv pip install -e .
```

Headless video recording additionally requires `ffmpeg`, and the interactive
viewer requires a working OpenGL/display environment. If any step above
doesn't work as shown (no `python3.12`, `uv venv` missing `pip`, no display),
see [`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## 5-minute example

Validate that the reference robot embodiment loads correctly:

```bash
bimanual-redopt validate-robot --robot dual_franka_panda
```

This prints the controlled joint count and the resolved `qpos`/DoF indices:
a sanity check that the MuJoCo model, submodule, and environment are wired
up correctly.

Then run a short, headless smoke pass of one paper campaign end to end
(scene construction, controller, and CSV recording, at a tiny simulated
duration, checking plumbing rather than publication statistics):

```bash
bimanual-redopt run --config configs/paper/static.toml --smoke
```

The command prints the output directory it wrote under
`outputs/paper_reproduction/`.

## Reproduce the paper

Every manuscript campaign is driven by a TOML config under `configs/paper/`
through the same CLI:

| Paper config | Command | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `static.toml` | `bimanual-redopt run --config configs/paper/static.toml` | Static optimization campaign (Figures 10, 12) |
| `six_d.toml` | `bimanual-redopt run --config configs/paper/six_d.toml` | Representative 6D trajectories (Figure 11, part of Figure 14/Table I) |
| `translational.toml` | `bimanual-redopt run --config configs/paper/translational.toml` | Translational pick-and-place (Figure 13, part of Table I) |
| `directional_direct_vs_indirect.toml` | `bimanual-redopt run --config configs/paper/directional_direct_vs_indirect.toml` | Direct vs. indirect directional-force comparison (Figure 16) |

Run every campaign in one call with `bimanual-redopt reproduce-paper`, or
`bimanual-redopt reproduce-paper --smoke` for the short plumbing check above.

For the full manuscript-figure-level breakdown and output provenance, see
[`docs/REPRODUCING_THE_PAPER.md`](docs/REPRODUCING_THE_PAPER.md). For
per-script interactive/ad hoc experiment usage outside the config-driven
pipeline, see [`docs/RUNNING_EXPERIMENTS.md`](docs/RUNNING_EXPERIMENTS.md).

## Paper <-> Code

[`docs/PAPER_CODE_MAP.md`](docs/PAPER_CODE_MAP.md) is the authoritative
equation index: every manuscript equation number maps to its implementing
function, file, and test, for example:

| Eq. | What | Function | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | Closed-loop redundancy update law | `Equation8Controller.update` | `core/controller.py` |
| 13 | Velocity manipulability | `velocity_cost` | `core/objectives.py` |
| 16 | Directional force (direct) | `directional_force_direct_cost` | `core/objectives.py` |

breakdown and dependency direction.

## Hardware implementation

The manuscript also reports planar dual-arm hardware experiments. That
hardware implementation is not distributed in this public repository, and
the hardware results are not reproducible from this codebase; only the
spatial MuJoCo simulation study is.

For research inquiries regarding access to the planar hardware
implementation, please contact Barat S.:

## Adding another robot

The framework supports additional cooperative robot embodiments through
`CooperativeSystemSpec`, a minimal specification interface that separates
the generic manipulability mathematics from any one robot's kinematics,
actuation, or MuJoCo model. See
[`docs/ADDING_A_ROBOT.md`](docs/ADDING_A_ROBOT.md) for the extension
interface and checklist.

Contributions are welcome for additional robot embodiments, cooperative
grasp configurations, new task-specific objectives, analytical/autodiff
gradient implementations, and benchmarking/reproduction tooling. See
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Development

After [Quick start](#quick-start), install the test dependencies and run the
suite from the repository root:

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup, branch naming, and
guidelines for adding robots, objectives, or new mathematics.

## Limitations

- The grasp is generated by physical fingertip contact; there is no weld,
  teleport, or hidden object attachment.
- The manuscript's planar hardware experiments are not distributed or
  reproducible from this repository (see
  [Hardware implementation](#hardware-implementation)).
- Legacy ROS/Gazebo code requires a separate ROS 1 workspace and is not
  installed by the repository-local Python environment.
